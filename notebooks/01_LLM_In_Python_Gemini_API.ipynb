      "* **Aesthetic Appeal:** The design complements the existing architectural style of central London, preserving its heritage while incorporating innovative technology.\n",
      "* **Sustainability:**  The use of renewable energy sources and sustainable materials contributes to a more environmentally friendly building.\n",
      "* **Adaptability:** The modular design allows for customization to suit different building sizes and shapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Cost:**  Integrating carbon capture technologies into a facade can be costly. \n",
      "* **Maintenance:**  Regular cleaning and maintenance of the carbon capture elements are essential for optimal performance.\n",
      "* **Integration with Existing Buildings:**  Adapting the design to existing buildings might require specific engineering solutions.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Ventilated Facade:** This system is ideal for hot climates. It creates an air gap between the cladding and the building's insulation, allowing for natural ventilation and reducing heat gain. \n",
      "    * **Materials:**\n",
      "        * **Lightweight Metal Panels:** Aluminum or galvanized steel panels are excellent choices due to their durability, low weight, and ability to be easily formed into various shapes.\n",
      "        * **High-Performance Ceramic Tiles:**  These offer excellent thermal insulation and can be designed to reflect solar radiation.\n",
      "        * **Composite Panels:** Combining materials like wood, metal, and insulation can create a lightweight and energy-efficient system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Glazing Percentage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Minimize Glazing:**  In a hot climate, maximizing solar heat gain through large windows is detrimental to energy efficiency. Aim for a lower glazing percentage to reduce heat load.\n",
      "* **Strategic Glazing:**  \n",
      "    * **Shading:**  Use overhangs, louvers, or brise-soleil (sunshades) to block direct sunlight during peak hours.\n",
      "    * **High-Performance Glazing:**  Employ low-emissivity (low-E) glass with coatings that reflect infrared radiation, reducing heat transfer.\n",
      "    * **Triple-Glazed Units:**  These offer superior insulation compared to single or double-glazed units.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Glazing Percentage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **20-30%:** This range strikes a balance between natural light and heat gain reduction. \n",
      "* **Consider Orientation:**  South-facing facades should have the lowest glazing percentage, while north-facing facades can have slightly higher glazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Insulation:**  Proper insulation is crucial for energy efficiency. Use high-performance insulation materials within the wall cavity.\n",
      "* **Solar Control:**  Incorporate passive solar design elements like overhangs, trees, and vegetation to shade the building and reduce heat gain.\n",
      "* **Ventilation:**  Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent overheating and maintain comfortable indoor temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Facade Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ventilated Facade:**  Use lightweight aluminum panels with a high-performance ceramic tile accent wall.\n",
      "* **Glazing:**  25% glazing with triple-glazed low-E windows strategically placed on north-facing facades.\n",
      "* **Shading:**  Implement overhangs and brise-soleil on south-facing facades.\n",

      "Creating an enclosure to mediate the environment is one of the basic needs of \n",
      "human being. Protection against excessive climatic conditions, natural disasters or other \n",
      "humans or animals are the primary incentive of this need. Starting from this point on, it \n",
      "can be stated that, the major purpose of cladding is to separate the indoor environment \n",
      "from the outdoors in such a way that indoor environment conditions can be maintained \n",
      "at level suitable for the buildings intended use.  Therefore from the functional point of \n",
      "view it can be defined as, the part of the building that is non load bearing exterior wall \n",
      "that must defend the interior spaces against invasion by water, wind, sun, light, heat and \n",
      "cold, and all the other forces of nature. Besides this it must also fulfill the aesthetic, \n",
      "economic and security considerations. Because of these reasons its design is an intricate \n",
      "process that merges the art, science and craft to solve a very long and difficult list of \n",
      "problems.  The design of the building façade has become much more complicated with \n",
      "development of new methods of construction, the requirements for a highly controlled \n",
      "interior environments, stress on energy efficiency, advent of materials and new \n",
      "production methods. As a measure of responsibility on the part of architects the \n",
      "envelope needs to be well designed. \n",
      "The terms, cladding and curtain wall are sometimes confusing in the technical \n",
      "literature. Even in technical dictionaries the terms cladding and curtain wall are defined \n",
      "with similar properties i.e. non- load bearing wall of a skeleton frame (Osterle 2003). \n",
      "made a distinction between solid and transparent facades. According to them, the non-\n",
      "transparent area of the façade will be thermally insulated and then rendered or finished \n",
      "with modern cladding systems. The cladding with a ventilated cavity to the rear is fixed \n",
      "with carcass structure. Stone is one of the cladding materials used for these non –\n",
      "transparent facades. According to the definition of curtain wall by Osterle, the curtain \n",
      "wall is separated from the structure and its structure, suspended between the floors of \n",
      "the buildings and façade elements can be prefabricated. The type of infill material is not \n",
      "important in most of the definitions (Schaupp 1967). explained the development of\n",
      "\n",
      "9 stone facades with stone adhered to the back structure to ventilated walls and he named \n",
      "this ventilated stone wall as a curtain wall, but this should be called as stone cladding \n",
      "since there is a direct connection of the stone panels to the backup wall (Musaa\u0004ao\u0004lu \n",
      "2005).  \n",
      "But in most common sense the cladding wall is described as “the finish covering \n",
      "of an exterior wall of frame building; the siding may be cladding material such as wood, \n",
      "aluminum or asbestos cement (but not masonry) applied vertically or horizontally” in \n",
      "the dictionary of architecture and construction, prepared by Harris (Harris 1993).  \n",
      "According to Linda Brock however, the term cladding denotes the visible materials on \n",
      "the exterior of the wall. Cladding act as the primary whether barrier, and as such they \n",
      "are sometimes called a rain screen. Some claddings such as insulated glass units \n",
      "perform all of the walls functions (Brock 2005). \n",
      "Allen also unites the concepts of curtain walls and cladding walls. According to \n",
      "her, the name “curtain wall” drives from the idea that the wall is thin and “hangs” like a \n",
      "curtain on the structural frame (Most of curtain wall panels do not actually hang in \n",
      "tension from the frame, but supported from the bottom at each floor level) The earliest \n",
      "curtain walls were constructed of masonry The principle advantage of the curtain wall is \n",
      "that because it bears no vertical load, it can be thin and light in weight regardless of the \n",
      "height of the building, as compared to a masonry load bearing wall, which may be \n",
      "become prohibitively thick and weighty at the base of a very tall building (Allen 2004).  \n",
      "But most of the definition is made in relations to the structure of the building. \n",
      "For example; according to Ochshorn, the curtain wall is defined in terms of its \n",
      "functional relationship to the building's structure. It then refers to the cladding, or \n",
      "enclosure, of a building as something both separate from and attached to the building's \n",
      "skeletal framework (Ochshorn 2003). Where load bearing walls provide both structure \n",
      "and enclosure, there can be no curtain wall. But difficulties emerge within this \n",
      "definition when the question of \"infill\" is considered: are conventional windows (or \n",
      "other infill material), when fixed inside the boundaries of a structural frame, considered \n",
      "to represent curtain wall construction? Such construction is certainly \"attached\" to the \n",
      "structural frame, but not exactly \"hanging\" from it. When is a window just a window \n",
      "within a frame, and when does it transform into a curtain wall? The answer may have \n",
      "more to do with one's aesthetic bias than with the actual functional relationship between \n",
      "cladding and structure. Another and more comprehensive definition of the curtain wall \n",
      "is made by Quirouette; a curtain wall system is a lightweight exterior cladding which is\n",
      "\n",
      "10 hung on the building structure, usually from floor to floor. It can provide a variety of \n",
      "exterior appearances but characterized by narrowly spaced vertical and horizontal caps \n",
      "with glass or metal infill panels. These systems provide a finished exterior appearance \n",
      "and most often a semi-finished interior as well (Quirouette 1982). They are also \n",
      "designed to accommodate structural deflections, control wind-driven rain and leakage, \n",
      "minimize the effects of solar radiation and provide for maintenance-free long term \n",
      "performance. Most of today's metal curtain wall systems are constructed of lightweight \n",
      "aluminum, although some may be of steel.  \n",

      "existence, the intention of creating large openings on it was first seen in the gothic \n",
      "architecture.  But the concept of fully glazed wall developed fitfully soon after this \n",
